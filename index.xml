      <title>Provenance of eclogite in the Bohemian massif: Geochemical and geochronological study of eclogite from the Krušné hory, Marianské Lázně, and Velké Vrbno units</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eclogite is the high-pressure equivalent of basaltic igneous rocks and are widely distributed throughout the Bohemian massif (Fig. 1; Konopásek, 2011; Massonne, 2011 and references therein). Eclogite has important geodynamic significance for the identification of terrane boundaries, and exploring the circulation and interaction of materials deep below the earth’s surface. Study of their metamorphic transformations and evolution can provide important insights into the evolution of subduction zone and collisional orogenesis (e.g. Štípská et al. 2012; Faryad et al. 2013; Collett et al., 2017). However, relatively less attention is paid to the origin of the eclogite protoliths, their provenance and geodynamic setting. Understanding of this early evolution, prior to HP transformation, is critical to interpreting the significance of eclogite exposures. Geochemical and geochronological investigation provides powerful tools for deciphering the nature of eclogite protoliths as well as assessment of elemental fluxes in and out of these eclogites during subduction zone metamorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of inherited continental margin architecture on early Variscan convergence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the inherited architecture of extended continental margins controls the collisional processes and deformation structure of ensuing orogens. However, the classical hyper-extended margins of the Atlantic type differ substantially from the extended continental margins above the west-Pacific subduction systems, which are characterized by massive crustal melting, intrusion of large portions of mafic magmas and HT-LP metamorphism. In this project, we focus on a Pacific type hot margin developed during Ordovician times along the northern margin of Gondwana and was subsequently incorporated into the Devonian subduction-collisional structure of the western margin of the Bohemian Massif. We rely on a multidisciplinary approach combining geological and geophysical methods to characterize the architecture of such an orogen and propose its evolutionary thermomechanical model which will be tested by means of numerical modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Institutional Support and Twinning in Geoscience between Kabul, Peshawar, Leicester, Prague and Keele Universities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s higher education provision suffered immensely due to 30 years of conflict and the long-term neglect of universities under Taliban rule. This project funded by the British Council under the Development Partnerships in Higher Education (DelPHE) scheme was designed at institutional strengthening of geology departments in Peshawar in Pakistan and Kabul in Afghanistan through partnerships with Leicester, Keele and Prague universities. The project included collaborative research, workshops, conferences, and faculty exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
